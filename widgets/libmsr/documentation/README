to earlier versions of this library.
==========================================

To build the library:

Set NUM_PACKAGES and NUM_CORES_PER_PACKAGE in msr_core.h.  
Run make.


A note on terminology:

"Socket" is equivalent to the Intel term "package".


libmsr allows simpler reading and writing of model-specific 
registers.  This release targets the server version of the
Intel Sandy Bridge processors.  The library requires the
msr kernel module to be loaded.  

libmsr also provides higher-level APIs.  This version 
contains an interface to control Intel's Running Average
Power Limit (RAPL) features.  Future APIs will include
turbo mode, clocks, fixed-function hardware performance
counters, thermal management and Precise Event-Based
Sampling (PEBS), as well as support for hyperthreading
and other processors.
