Installation
------------
This is the dbglog library. dbgLogTester.C contains a representative application 
that illustrates the use of the library. To compile the library and the example, 
just type 

make

Example code
------------
To view the results of the example, run:

./dbgLogTester

This produces directory dbg/ with the debug output. View file dbg/index.1-0.html 
with Firefox (other browsers currently have issues with dbglog output) to read 
the output produced by dbgLogTester.

Graphviz support
----------------
The example includes the generation of graphviz dot graphs. To identify the path 
of the graphviz library modify line 5 of the Makefile to specify this path. The 
default setting corresponds to the graphviz bin directory being on the PATH. If 
graphviz is not available, comment line 5 out and dbglog will emit warnings for 
all the dot graphs the user wishes to print.
