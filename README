Installation
------------
run "make"

Example codes
-------------
To view the results of the example, run "make runExamples". This executes the codes in
directory examples/, producing directories 
  dbglog/examples/dbg.1.StructuredFormatting/
  dbglog/examples/dbg.2.ConditionalFormatting/
  dbglog/examples/dbg.3.Navigation/
  dbglog/examples/dbg.4.AttributeAnnotationFiltering/
  dbglog/examples/dbg.5.Tracing/
  dbglog/examples/dbg.6.PerfAnalysis/
To understand the APIs provided by dbglog please look at the source and the output of these
codes since each one focuses on a specific portion of the API.

"make runExamples" also executes the dbglog-enhanced applications in directory apps/, producing directories 
  dbglog/dbg.MCBenchmark/
  dbglog/dbg.MFEM.ex1/
  dbglog/dbg.MFEM.ex2/
  dbglog/dbg.MFEM.ex3/
  dbglog/dbg.MFEM.ex4/
These illustrate how dbglog may fit into a larger application, specifically MCBench and MFEM.

To view the output of a given run look at file dbg.*/index.html with Firefox (other browsers 
are currently not supported).
